            <h2>Top 20 Nationwide YVIP Finalist</h2>
            <p>I am proud to have achieved recognition as a top 20 finalist nationwide in the prestigious Fall 2022 'Your Voice is Power' remix competition. Hosted by the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with Amazon Future Engineer and YELLOW, the competition integrates computer science coding with music to explore themes of racial equity and entrepreneurship. Competing alongside over 600 students from across the United States and Guam, I utilized Georgia Tech's innovative EarSketch platform to create a remix that resonated with messages of social justice. This experience underscores my passion for combining technology and creativity, laying a foundation for my aspirations in machine learning/AI or software engineering.</p>
